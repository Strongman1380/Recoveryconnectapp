## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- Never commit your API key to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity

### User Privacy
- Conversations are not stored permanently
- No user identification is sent to OpenAI
- Crisis interventions are handled locally when possible
- Clear privacy policy covers AI interactions

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

### Modifying the Recovery Specialist Prompt
The system prompt is configured in `config.js` under `RECOVERY_SPECIALIST_PROMPT`. You can customize:
- Specific therapeutic approaches to emphasize
- Additional safety protocols
- Specialized knowledge areas
- Response style preferences

### Crisis Keywords
Crisis detection keywords can be modified in `recovery-assistant.js` in the `detectCrisisKeywords` method.

### Conversation History

- `maxHistoryLength`: Number of message exchanges to remember
- Model parameters: temperature, max_tokens, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Usage Tracking
- Monitor OpenAI API usage in your dashboard
- Track conversation metrics if needed
- Monitor for crisis interventions
